this is a project was made for a client, the idea of the project it is web app allow you
to manage your buildings

so you have the admin area where you can see the people who are using the app to manage
their app so their you can add new users or edit or delete

and you have the web app itself where you find buildings page where you can add the
building and its apartments number, the apartments page where you can see the aparments
and their info and final the financial page where you can see the finance status of every
apratment,

this project is just the static jsx so is still missing the logic (state) and the backend.

for now we quit the project because some problem with the client althoug i may need it
somewhere else
